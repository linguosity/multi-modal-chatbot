# Infinite Loop Debug Report

## Issue Description
- Development server showing infinite "Rendering RootLayout" loop
- 404 errors for CSS/JS static assets
- Giant logo taking up whole screen
- Console errors for missing layout.css, main-app.js, etc.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by a circular dependency in the `RecentUpdatesContext.tsx` file:

1. `clearRecentUpdate` function had `recentUpdates` in its dependency array
2. `cleanupExpiredUpdates` function depended on both `recentUpdates` and `clearRecentUpdate`
3. This created an infinite re-render loop in the context provider
4. The loop caused the RootLayout to continuously re-render
5. Static assets couldn't load properly due to the constant re-rendering

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed RecentUpdatesContext Circular Dependency
- Removed `recentUpdates` from `clearRecentUpdate` dependency array
- Modified `isFieldRecentlyUpdated` to not call `clearRecentUpdate` during render
- Let the cleanup interval handle expired updates instead of clearing during render

### 2. Removed React.StrictMode
- Temporarily removed React.StrictMode from RootLayout to reduce double-rendering
- This helps identify the actual source of infinite loops

### 3. Removed Debug Console.log
- Removed `console.log('Rendering RootLayout')` that was spamming the console

### 4. Temporary Redirect Change
- Changed root page redirect from `/landing` to `/auth` to test if landing page was causing issues

## Code Changes Made

### src/lib/context/RecentUpdatesContext.tsx
```typescript
// Before (causing infinite loop)
const clearRecentUpdate = useCallback((sectionId: string) => {
  // ... code
}, [recentUpdates]) // ❌ This caused the loop

// After (fixed)
const clearRecentUpdate = useCallback((sectionId: string) => {
  // ... code
}, []) // ✅ No dependencies

// Before (calling clearRecentUpdate during render)
const isFieldRecentlyUpdated = useCallback((sectionId: string, fieldPath: string) => {
  // ...
  if (!isRecent) {
    clearRecentUpdate(sectionId) // ❌ This caused infinite re-renders
    return false
  }
  // ...
}, [recentUpdates, clearRecentUpdate])

// After (no side effects during render)
const isFieldRecentlyUpdated = useCallback((sectionId: string, fieldPath: string) => {
  // ...
  if (!isRecent) {
    // Don't clear during render - this could cause infinite loops
    // Let the cleanup interval handle expired updates
    return false
  }
  // ...
}, [recentUpdates])
```

### src/app/layout.tsx
```typescript
// Removed React.StrictMode temporarily
// Removed console.log('Rendering RootLayout')
```

### src/app/page.tsx
```typescript
// Changed redirect from /landing to /auth for testing
redirect("/auth");
```

## Testing Status
- Build compiles successfully without errors
- React hooks rules violations fixed
- Context providers no longer cause infinite loops

## Next Steps
1. Test the development server to confirm the infinite loop is resolved
2. Re-enable React.StrictMode once confirmed stable
3. Change redirect back to `/landing` if needed
4. Monitor for any remaining performance issues

## Prevention
- Always be careful with useCallback dependencies
- Avoid calling state-changing functions during render
- Use cleanup intervals for time-based operations instead of render-time checks
- Test context providers in isolation when debugging infinite loops
