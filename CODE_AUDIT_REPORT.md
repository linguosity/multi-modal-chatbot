### 1. Project Tooling & Configuration Analysis

**`package.json` Overview:**
*   **Scripts:**
    *   `dev`: `next dev` (Standard Next.js development server)
    *   `build`: `next build` (Standard Next.js production build)
    *   `start`: `next start` (Standard Next.js production server)
    *   `lint`: `next lint` (Standard Next.js ESLint integration)
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   Core Frameworks: `next`, `react`, `react-dom` (all recent versions).
    *   AI/NLP: `@anthropic-ai/sdk` (for Claude integration).
    *   UI Components: `@radix-ui/react-label`, `@radix-ui/react-select`, `@radix-ui/react-slot`, `@radix-ui/react-tooltip` (Radix UI for accessible components).
    *   Styling: `tailwind-merge`, `tailwindcss-animate`, `clsx` (Tailwind CSS utilities).
    *   Supabase: `@supabase/ssr`, `@supabase/supabase-js` (for backend integration).
    *   Text Editor: `@tiptap/react`, `@tiptap/starter-kit` (for rich text editing).
    *   Icons: `lucide-react`.
    *   Drag-and-Drop: `@dnd-kit/core`, `@dnd-kit/sortable`, `@dnd-kit/utilities` (for interactive UI elements).
    *   Utilities: `uuid`, `zod` (for UUID generation and schema validation).
    *   Logging: `pino`, `pino-pretty`.
*   **Dev Dependencies:**
    *   ESLint: `eslint`, `eslint-config-next`, `@eslint/config-array`, `@eslint/object-schema`.
    *   Tailwind CSS: `postcss`, `tailwindcss`, `autoprefixer`, `@tailwindcss/forms`, `@tailwindcss/typography`.
    *   TypeScript: `typescript`, `@types/node`, `@types/react`, `@types/react-dom`.

**`tsconfig.json` Overview:**
*   Standard Next.js TypeScript configuration.
*   `"strict": true` is enabled, which is excellent for type safety.
*   `"esModuleInterop": true` is enabled, which helps with module import compatibility.
*   `"paths": { "@/*": ["./src/*"] }` is configured for absolute imports, promoting cleaner code.

**`.eslintrc.json` Overview:**
*   A `.eslintrc.json` file is present and configured with `"root": true` to ensure ESLint uses the project-specific configuration.
*   The `lint` script in `package.json` explicitly points to this configuration file (`next lint --config ./.eslintrc.json`).
*   It extends `@typescript-eslint/recommended` and `react-hooks/recommended`, enforcing good practices for TypeScript and React hooks.

**`postcss.config.js` Overview:**
*   Standard PostCSS configuration for Tailwind CSS and Autoprefixer.

**`tailwind.config.ts` Overview:**
*   Standard Tailwind CSS configuration.
*   Includes `@tailwindcss/typography` and `@tailwindcss/forms` plugins.
*   Defines custom color palettes and shadows, indicating a tailored design system.

### 2. Code Audit Findings

**A. Code Style & Consistency:**
*   **Overall:** The codebase generally follows a consistent style, utilizing Tailwind CSS for styling and `shadcn/ui` components.
*   **ESLint:** A comprehensive `.eslintrc.json` is now in place, enforcing stricter rules and project-specific best practices.
*   **`console` statements:** Reverted to `console.log`/`warn`/`error` from structured logging. (Previous implementation of structured logging was removed).

**B. Error Handling Patterns:**
*   **API Routes:** Error handling in API routes primarily relies on checking the `error` object returned by Supabase calls and returning `NextResponse` with appropriate status codes and JSON error messages. This is a good pattern.
*   **Frontend:** Frontend error handling uses `useState` to store `error` messages and displays them in the UI. `try...catch` blocks are used around `fetch` calls.

**C. Dependency Management:**
*   **Dependencies:** The `package.json` lists a comprehensive set of modern and relevant libraries for a Next.js project with Supabase, AI, and rich UI.
*   **Drag-and-Drop:** The project has successfully transitioned from `sortable-tree` to `@dnd-kit` for robust and flexible drag-and-drop functionality, particularly in the template editor.

**D. Potential Performance Areas:**
*   **API Data Fetching:** `select('*')` is used in several API routes. While convenient, it can fetch more data than necessary. For performance optimization, consider selecting only the required columns.
*   **Frontend Re-renders:** With complex DND logic and state management, ensure components are memoized (`React.memo`) where appropriate to prevent unnecessary re-renders. (This is part of Phase 3 of the DND roadmap).

**E. Basic Security Indicators:**
*   **Environment Variables:** `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are correctly used. The `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix ensures they are exposed to the browser. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is used on the server-side only, which is correct.
*   **Authentication:** Supabase's `auth.getUser()` is consistently used to check user authentication and authorization in API routes, which is crucial for security.
*   **Row Level Security (RLS):** The RLS policies for `report_templates` and `report_section_types` are correctly implemented to restrict access to user-owned data.

**F. Multimodal Input (Current State):**
*   `src/app/api/ai/generate-section/route.ts` is set up to receive `unstructuredInput` (text) and `files` (base64 encoded).
*   It correctly handles image types (`image/jpeg`, `image/png`, etc.) for Claude.
*   It explicitly warns and skips PDF files and other unsupported types. This is a good temporary measure, but PDF processing will require a dedicated solution.

### 3. Recommendations for Refactoring & Improvement:

1.  **Implement PDF Text Extraction:** For the multimodal input, integrate a library or service to extract text from PDFs on the server-side before sending it to Claude.
2.  **Structured Logging:** Implemented structured logging using Pino.
3.  **API Data Selection:** Review all `supabase.from(...).select('*')` calls in API routes and narrow down the selected columns to only what's necessary.
4.  **Frontend Loading States:** Implement more granular loading states and skeleton loaders for a better user experience, especially during data fetching and AI generation.
5.  **Comprehensive ESLint Configuration:** Create a `.eslintrc.js` or `.eslintrc.json` file to enforce project-specific coding standards, potentially including rules for `console` usage in production.
6.  **Performance Profiling:** Once the core features are stable, use Next.js's built-in performance tools and browser developer tools to profile runtime performance and identify bottlenecks.
