# 🔧 Debug Fixes Applied

## 🎯 **Main Issue Identified**
The structured data was being successfully updated in the database, but the UI wasn't showing it because:

1. **UI Component wasn't reading structured_data** - `DynamicStructuredBlock` was getting `initialData={{}}` instead of `section.structured_data`
2. **Visual indicators were lost on page refresh** - `RecentUpdatesContext` state was cleared when page reloaded

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Fixed Data Display Issue**
**Before:**
```tsx
<DynamicStructuredBlock
  schema={currentSchema}
  initialData={{}} // ❌ Empty object!
  mode={mode}
```

**After:**
```tsx
<DynamicStructuredBlock
  schema={currentSchema}
  initialData={section.structured_data || {}} // ✅ Actual data!
  mode={mode}
```

### 2. **Fixed Visual Indicators Persistence**
**Before:** Visual indicators were lost on page refresh

**After:** Added localStorage persistence to `RecentUpdatesContext`:
- Saves updates to localStorage
- Loads updates on page mount
- Auto-cleans old updates (30+ seconds)

### 3. **Added Enhanced Debugging**
- Console logs when structured data is passed to components
- Console logs when sections have recent updates
- Visual debugging for TOC indicators

## 🧪 **What You Should See Now**

1. **Upload assessment notes** to a structured section
2. **Check console logs** - you should see:
   ```
   📊 Passing structured_data to Section Name: {actual data object}
   ✨ Section abc123 (Section Name) is recently updated: {update info}
   ```
3. **Look at the section content** - form fields should now be populated with AI data
4. **Check TOC** - updated sections should have sparkles ✨ and animations
5. **Toast notification** should appear showing what was updated

## 🔍 **Expected Behavior**

### In the Form Fields:
- **Text fields** should show the extracted text (e.g., "Typical milestones except for late talking (~2 yrs)")
- **Boolean fields** should be checked/unchecked based on AI analysis
- **Nested object fields** should be populated (e.g., `language.receptive`, `language.expressive`)

### In the TOC:
- **Sparkles icon** ✨ next to updated sections
- **Gradient background** with green accent
- **Update count badge** showing number of fields changed
- **Pulsing animation** for 30 seconds

### In Console:
- Detailed logs showing exactly what data is being passed around
- Visual indicator debugging info

## 🎉 **Test It Now!**

Try uploading the same assessment notes again and you should see:
1. ✅ **Form fields populated** with the AI-extracted data
2. ✅ **Visual sparkles** in the TOC
3. ✅ **Toast notification** showing what was updated
4. ✅ **Console logs** confirming data flow

The structured data processing is working perfectly - now the UI should finally show it! 🚀
