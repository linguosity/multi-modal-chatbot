- **Rich Content**: Expandable processing details
- **Stacking Animation**: Smooth entrance with stagger

### 2. **Enhanced Toast Data**
```typescript
processingData: {
  summary: string           // Claude's processing summary
  updatedSections: string[] // Which sections were updated
  processedFiles: Array<{   // Files that were processed
    name: string
    type: string
    size: number
  }>
