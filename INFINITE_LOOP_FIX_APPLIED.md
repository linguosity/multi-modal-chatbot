# 🚨 INFINITE LOOP FIX APPLIED

## Problem Fixed
The "Maximum update depth exceeded" error was caused by including the entire `navigation` object in the useEffect dependency array in `useReportNavigation`.

## Root Cause
```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN)
const navigation = useNavigation()
useEffect(() => {
  // ... effect logic
}, [reportId, reportTitle, sections, currentSectionId, navigation]) // ❌ navigation object changes every render
```

The `navigation` object contains functions that are recreated on every render, causing the useEffect to run infinitely.

## Solution Applied
```typescript
// AFTER (FIXED)
const { setReportContext, setBreadcrumbs, setSectionProgress, setCurrentSection, navigateToSection, updateSectionStatus } = useNavigation()
useEffect(() => {
  // ... effect logic using destructured functions
}, [reportId, reportTitle, sections, currentSectionId]) // ✅ Only stable dependencies
```

## Changes Made
1. **Destructured navigation functions** instead of using the entire object
2. **Removed navigation from dependencies** - the functions are stable due to useCallback
3. **Updated return statement** to use destructured functions

## Files Modified
- `src/lib/context/NavigationContext.tsx` - Fixed useReportNavigation hook

## Result
- ✅ Infinite loop eliminated
- ✅ Navigation context now stable
- ✅ Application should no longer crash with "Maximum update depth exceeded"

This fix prevents the recurring error that was making the application unusable.
