Pitch and loudness were generally appropriate for his age and gender, but occasional vocal fry was noted. He demonstrated mild vocal fatigue after sustained speaking tasks. During the vocal hygiene interview, Brandon reported infrequent water intake and occasional yelling during play.\n\n### Oral Mechanism Examination\n\nResults of the oral mechanism examination were within normal limits for speech production. All structures (lips, tongue, jaw, palate) appeared symmetrical and moved with adequate range, strength, and coordination.\n\n### Language Sample Analysis\n\nAnalysis of Brandon's spontaneous speech revealed age-appropriate vocabulary, sentence structure, and grammatical skills. Articulation was clear and intelligible in conversational speech. No significant disfluencies were observed. His pragmatic language skills were also age-appropriate, demonstrating good turn-taking, topic maintenance, and conversational repair strategies.\n\n### Classroom Observation\n\nDuring classroom observation, Brandon participated actively in discussions. His voice was audible, but instances of increased vocal effort and occasional hoarseness were noted during periods of sustained talking or when speaking over background noise. He demonstrated appropriate social communication skills with peers and teachers.\n\n### Summary of Findings\n\nBrandon presents with a mild voice disorder characterized by intermittent hoarseness and vocal fatigue. His oral motor skills, articulation, language, and fluency are within normal limits. The voice difficulties appear to be primarily related to vocal behaviors and habits rather than structural or neurological issues.
