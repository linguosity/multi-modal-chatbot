# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating Linguosity's AI processing system from Claude Opus 4.1 to GPT-5 to achieve significant cost savings, improved context handling, and better integration with our TipTap editor workflow. The migration will maintain all existing functionality while leveraging GPT-5's advantages including 10x lower costs, larger context windows, and plaintext custom tools that eliminate JSON escaping issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Speech-Language Pathologist, I want the AI processing to continue working seamlessly during the migration, so that my report generation workflow is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I generate a report section THEN the system SHALL produce output with the same quality and structure as before
2. WHEN I upload files for processing THEN the system SHALL handle PDFs, images, and audio with equivalent or better accuracy
3. WHEN I edit content in TipTap THEN the AI assistance SHALL work without formatting issues or escaped characters
4. IF the migration encounters errors THEN the system SHALL automatically fallback to Claude processing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor the migration progress and performance, so that I can ensure the transition is successful and cost-effective.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is active THEN the system SHALL log all API calls and response quality metrics
2. WHEN comparing costs THEN the system SHALL track token usage and expenses for both APIs
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging for debugging and rollback decisions
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive performance report

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the migration to be implemented with proper fallback mechanisms, so that system reliability is maintained throughout the transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GPT-5 API calls fail THEN the system SHALL automatically retry with Claude as backup
2. WHEN response validation fails THEN the system SHALL attempt re-processing with stricter prompts
3. WHEN JSON schema validation fails THEN the system SHALL apply data integrity guards before saving
4. IF both APIs fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages to users

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Speech-Language Pathologist, I want improved performance with large documents and multi-modal content, so that I can process comprehensive assessments more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I upload large PDF documents THEN the system SHALL process them within the expanded context window
2. WHEN I include multiple files and historical data THEN the system SHALL maintain context across all inputs
3. WHEN processing audio transcripts THEN the system SHALL handle longer recordings without truncation
4. WHEN generating reports with extensive background data THEN the system SHALL produce more comprehensive outputs

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Speech-Language Pathologist, I want seamless TipTap editor integration, so that I can edit AI-generated content without formatting issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI generates content for TipTap THEN the system SHALL provide clean markdown/HTML without JSON escaping
2. WHEN I request inline edits THEN the system SHALL apply changes directly without wrapper parsing
3. WHEN working with structured content THEN the system SHALL maintain proper formatting and structure
4. WHEN using custom tools THEN the system SHALL handle raw text inputs and outputs efficiently

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want to achieve significant cost savings, so that the platform can scale economically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing equivalent workloads THEN the system SHALL reduce AI processing costs by at least 80%
2. WHEN handling high-volume usage THEN the system SHALL maintain cost efficiency at scale
3. WHEN comparing monthly expenses THEN the system SHALL demonstrate measurable cost reduction
4. WHEN projecting future costs THEN the system SHALL show sustainable pricing for growth

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Speech-Language Pathologist, I want all existing features to continue working, so that my established workflows remain intact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using assessment processing THEN all current functionality SHALL remain available
2. WHEN generating structured data THEN the output format SHALL match existing schemas
3. WHEN accessing report templates THEN all template features SHALL work as before
4. WHEN using multi-modal processing THEN all file types SHALL be supported with equivalent quality
