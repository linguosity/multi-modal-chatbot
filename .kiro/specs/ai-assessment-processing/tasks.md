# AI Assessment Processing Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan converts the AI assessment processing design into a series of coding tasks that build incrementally on the existing Claude tool use architecture. Each task focuses on specific functionality while maintaining the current single-tool approach and extending it with multi-modal capabilities.

- [ ] 5. Build content integration and conflict resolution
  - Implement smart content merging that preserves existing content
  - Add conflict detection between new and existing content
  - Create user prompts for manual conflict resolution
  - Ensure proper formatting and structure preservation
