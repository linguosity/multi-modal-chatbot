# AI Assessment Processing Requirements

## ⚠️ CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT WARNING

**Stack Overflow Risk**: This feature processes complex assessment data and nested report structures. All implementations MUST use iterative algorithms, never recursive ones. See `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md` for mandatory patterns.

**Mandatory Before Implementation:**
- [ ] Review `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md` 
- [ ] Use iterative traversal for document processing
- [ ] Never use `JSON.stringify` in useEffect dependencies
- [ ] Gate debug logging behind environment flags

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the AI assistant to intelligently process assessment documents, notes, images, and PDFs to automatically populate report sections with structured data. The system will use Claude's tool use capabilities to extract relevant information and map it to appropriate report sections, with visual feedback showing which sections and fields were updated.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Modal Assessment Input Processing

**User Story:** As a speech-language pathologist, I want to upload assessment documents (PDFs, images) and paste unstructured notes so that the AI can automatically extract and organize relevant information into my report sections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads PDF documents THEN the system SHALL extract text content and process it for relevant assessment data
2. WHEN a user uploads images of assessment forms THEN the system SHALL use OCR to extract text and process the content
3. WHEN a user pastes unstructured assessment notes THEN the system SHALL parse and categorize the information
4. WHEN multiple input types are provided simultaneously THEN the system SHALL process all inputs together for comprehensive analysis
5. IF the uploaded file is not a supported format THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
6. WHEN processing large files THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators and handle timeouts gracefully

### Requirement 2: Intelligent Section Mapping and Population

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to automatically determine which report sections should be updated based on the assessment content so that I don't have to manually specify target sections for each piece of information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assessment data is processed THEN the AI SHALL analyze the content and determine relevant report sections to update
2. WHEN the AI identifies multiple relevant sections THEN the system SHALL populate all applicable sections with appropriate content
3. WHEN assessment data contains standardized test results THEN the AI SHALL map scores and interpretations to the Assessment Results section
4. WHEN assessment data contains background information THEN the AI SHALL populate Health/Developmental History and Family Background sections
5. WHEN assessment data contains parent/teacher concerns THEN the AI SHALL update the Parent Concerns section
6. IF the AI cannot determine appropriate sections THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to specify target sections
7. WHEN populating sections THEN the AI SHALL preserve existing content and append or merge new information appropriately

### Requirement 3: Structured Data Extraction with Tool Use

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to use Claude's tool use capabilities to extract structured data from unstructured assessment content so that the information is properly formatted and categorized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing assessment content THEN the system SHALL use Claude tools to extract structured data points
2. WHEN standardized test scores are found THEN the system SHALL extract test names, scores, percentiles, and interpretations
3. WHEN developmental milestones are mentioned THEN the system SHALL categorize them by domain (speech, language, motor, etc.)
4. WHEN background information is found THEN the system SHALL separate medical history, family history, and educational history
5. WHEN behavioral observations are noted THEN the system SHALL categorize them by setting and behavior type
6. WHEN recommendations are present THEN the system SHALL extract and format them as actionable items
7. IF extraction fails for any content THEN the system SHALL fall back to general text processing

### Requirement 4: Visual Update Indicators in TOC

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see visual indicators in the table of contents showing which sections were recently updated by AI so that I can quickly review the changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sections are updated by AI THEN the TOC SHALL display a subtle animation or indicator next to affected sections
2. WHEN individual fields within a section are updated THEN the system SHALL track and display field-level indicators
3. WHEN a user views an AI-updated section THEN the indicators SHALL fade or change to show the content has been reviewed
4. WHEN multiple sections are updated simultaneously THEN all affected sections SHALL show indicators
5. WHEN AI updates occur THEN the indicators SHALL persist until the user acknowledges or reviews the changes
6. IF no sections were updated THEN no indicators SHALL be displayed
7. WHEN the user manually edits a section THEN any AI update indicators for that section SHALL be cleared

### Requirement 5: Processing Status and Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback about the AI processing status and results so that I understand what happened and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI processing begins THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator with current processing step
2. WHEN processing completes successfully THEN the system SHALL show a summary of sections updated and key information extracted
3. WHEN processing encounters errors THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages and suggested actions
4. WHEN partial processing occurs THEN the system SHALL indicate which parts succeeded and which failed
5. WHEN no relevant information is found THEN the system SHALL inform the user and suggest alternative approaches
6. IF processing takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide status updates and allow cancellation
7. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL offer options to review changes or continue editing

### Requirement 6: Content Integration and Conflict Resolution

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to intelligently merge new assessment data with existing report content so that no information is lost and conflicts are resolved appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new data conflicts with existing content THEN the system SHALL present both versions and allow user selection
2. WHEN new data supplements existing content THEN the system SHALL merge the information seamlessly
3. WHEN duplicate information is detected THEN the system SHALL avoid redundant entries
4. WHEN updating structured sections THEN the system SHALL maintain proper formatting and organization
5. WHEN adding to list-based sections THEN the system SHALL append new items in logical order
6. IF content cannot be automatically merged THEN the system SHALL flag conflicts for manual review
7. WHEN merging content THEN the system SHALL preserve user-made customizations and formatting

### Requirement 7: Audit Trail and Undo Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to track what changes the AI made and be able to undo them if needed so that I maintain control over my report content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI makes changes THEN the system SHALL create a detailed audit trail of all modifications
2. WHEN a user wants to review changes THEN the system SHALL provide a clear before/after comparison
3. WHEN a user wants to undo AI changes THEN the system SHALL allow reverting to the previous state
4. WHEN multiple AI operations occur THEN the system SHALL allow selective undo of specific operations
5. WHEN changes are undone THEN the system SHALL update the visual indicators accordingly
6. IF undo operations fail THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and inform the user
7. WHEN audit trails are created THEN they SHALL include timestamps, source data, and change details
