# UI/UX Phase 2 Cleanup Requirements

## Introduction

Following the successful completion of Phase 1 refactoring (foundation cleanup and component consolidation), Phase 2 focuses on addressing critical UI/UX inconsistencies, implementing professional design standards, and eliminating remaining technical debt that impacts user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Design System Standardization

**User Story:** As a speech-language pathologist, I want a consistent and professional interface that doesn't distract from my clinical work, so that I can focus on creating quality evaluation reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate through the application THEN all typography follows a consistent 6-level hierarchy (xs, sm, base, lg, xl, 2xl)
2. WHEN I interact with form elements THEN all spacing follows a standardized 8px grid system
3. WHEN I view different components THEN all border radius values are consistent (4px, 6px, 8px, 12px only)
4. WHEN I use interactive elements THEN all colors follow semantic naming (primary, secondary, success, warning, error, info)
5. WHEN I access the application THEN all components meet WCAG AA accessibility standards

### Requirement 2: Component Architecture Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the Linguosity codebase, I want consolidated component patterns that eliminate duplication, so that I can efficiently implement new features and fix bugs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine modal implementations THEN there is only one BaseModal component used across the application
2. WHEN I review editor components THEN duplicate functionality is eliminated and consolidated into unified interfaces
3. WHEN I check form patterns THEN all forms use standardized FormField components with consistent validation
4. WHEN I inspect API routes THEN all routes use the createApiHandler pattern with proper error handling
5. WHEN I analyze the bundle THEN debug/development code is properly gated and doesn't appear in production

### Requirement 3: Navigation and Information Architecture

**User Story:** As a speech-language pathologist creating reports, I want clear navigation that shows my current location and progress, so that I can efficiently move between sections and understand report completion status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate through report sections THEN breadcrumb navigation shows my current location
2. WHEN I view the report sidebar THEN section completion status is clearly indicated with progress indicators
3. WHEN I switch between edit and view modes THEN the current mode is visually distinct
4. WHEN I use keyboard navigation THEN all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard shortcuts
5. WHEN I access the application on mobile/tablet THEN navigation adapts appropriately for touch interfaces

### Requirement 4: Data Entry and Form Experience

**User Story:** As a speech-language pathologist entering assessment data, I want intuitive forms with clear feedback and auto-save functionality, so that I don't lose my work and can efficiently complete evaluations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter data in forms THEN auto-save provides clear visual feedback about save status
2. WHEN I make form errors THEN validation messages appear inline with helpful guidance
3. WHEN I work with assessment tools THEN I can search, filter, and reorder items efficiently
4. WHEN I use structured data entry THEN field highlighting shows recent AI updates
5. WHEN I navigate between form fields THEN keyboard navigation follows logical tab order

### Requirement 5: Professional Polish and Performance

**User Story:** As a speech-language pathologist using Linguosity in a clinical setting, I want a fast, professional application that reflects the quality of my clinical work, so that I can confidently use it with colleagues and administrators.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I load the application THEN initial page load completes in under 2 seconds
2. WHEN I interact with components THEN micro-interactions provide smooth, professional feedback
3. WHEN I view reports THEN typography and spacing create a professional clinical document appearance
4. WHEN I use the application THEN loading states prevent confusion during data processing
5. WHEN I encounter errors THEN error messages are helpful and recovery options are clear

### Requirement 6: Technical Debt Elimination

**User Story:** As a developer working on Linguosity, I want clean, maintainable code without technical debt, so that I can implement new features efficiently and confidently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine the codebase THEN all TODO comments are resolved or converted to proper issue tracking
2. WHEN I review TypeScript usage THEN all `any` types are replaced with proper type definitions
3. WHEN I check for debug code THEN all console.log statements and debug panels are properly gated
4. WHEN I analyze component props THEN all interfaces are consistent and well-documented
5. WHEN I run the build process THEN no warnings or errors are present

## Success Metrics

- **User Task Completion Time**: 25% reduction in time to complete common workflows
- **Bundle Size**: Reduce from 635KB to 580KB (additional 55KB reduction)
- **Accessibility Score**: Achieve WCAG AA compliance (90%+ Lighthouse accessibility score)
- **Developer Experience**: Reduce component inconsistencies from 30% to under 10%
- **Performance**: Maintain sub-2 second load times while adding polish features
- **Code Quality**: Eliminate all TypeScript `any` types and resolve all TODO items

## Priority Order

1. **High Priority**: Design system standardization and component consolidation (immediate user impact)
2. **Medium Priority**: Navigation improvements and form experience enhancements (workflow efficiency)
3. **Medium Priority**: Professional polish and performance optimization (clinical credibility)
4. **Low Priority**: Technical debt cleanup (developer experience and maintainability)

## Out of Scope

- Major feature additions (new assessment tools, reporting formats)
- Database schema changes
- Authentication system modifications
- Third-party integrations beyond existing AI services

This phase builds directly on Phase 1 foundations to create a professional, efficient, and maintainable application that serves speech-language pathologists' clinical workflow needs.
