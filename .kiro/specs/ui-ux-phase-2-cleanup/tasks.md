## Success Criteria Validation

Each task should be validated against these criteria:
- **User Task Completion Time**: Measure workflow efficiency improvements
- **Bundle Size**: Track reduction from 635KB toward 580KB target
- **Accessibility Score**: Validate WCAG AA compliance with automated testing
- **Component Consistency**: Ensure standardized patterns across all components
- **Performance**: Maintain sub-2 second load times
- **Code Quality**: Eliminate TypeScript warnings and technical debt

## Implementation Notes

- Tasks 1-5 establish the foundation and should be completed first
- Tasks 6-10 build on the foundation to implement user-facing improvements
- Tasks 11-15 focus on polish, performance, and accessibility
- Tasks 16-20 add advanced features and final integration
- Each task should include proper testing and documentation
- All changes should be backwards compatible during the transition period
