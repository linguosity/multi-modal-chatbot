# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements drag-and-drop functionality for the Linguosity report generation system, allowing Speech-Language Pathologists to intuitively reorder report sections and template fields through direct manipulation. The feature enhances the existing sidebar navigation and template editing interfaces with smooth, accessible drag-and-drop interactions using the @dnd-kit library.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Speech-Language Pathologist, I want to reorder report sections by dragging them in the sidebar, so that I can organize my report structure to match my preferred workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I hover over a section in the sidebar THEN the system SHALL display a drag handle (⋮⋮) that indicates the item is draggable
2. WHEN I drag a section item THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback showing the item being moved with reduced opacity
3. WHEN I drop a section in a new position THEN the system SHALL update the section order immediately and persist the change
4. WHEN I use keyboard navigation (Tab + Space + Arrow keys) THEN the system SHALL support accessible drag-and-drop operations
5. IF a section is currently being edited THEN the system SHALL maintain the active state during and after reordering

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Speech-Language Pathologist, I want to reorder template fields when editing templates, so that I can customize the structure of report sections to match my assessment workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am in template editing mode THEN the system SHALL display drag handles for each field in the template
2. WHEN I drag a template field THEN the system SHALL show visual feedback and allow dropping in valid positions
3. WHEN I reorder template fields THEN the system SHALL update the field order and save changes to the template
4. WHEN fields are nested in groups THEN the system SHALL support drag-and-drop within each group independently
5. IF I attempt to drag a field outside its valid container THEN the system SHALL prevent the invalid drop operation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Speech-Language Pathologist, I want smooth visual feedback during drag operations, so that I can clearly understand what will happen when I drop an item.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start dragging an item THEN the system SHALL reduce the item's opacity to 0.5 to indicate it's being moved
2. WHEN I drag over valid drop zones THEN the system SHALL provide visual indicators of where the item will be placed
3. WHEN drag operations are in progress THEN the system SHALL use smooth CSS transitions for all position changes
4. WHEN I complete a drag operation THEN the system SHALL animate items to their final positions
5. IF a drag operation is cancelled THEN the system SHALL return the item to its original position with animation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Speech-Language Pathologist with accessibility needs, I want to reorder items using keyboard navigation, so that I can use the drag-and-drop functionality without a mouse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I press Tab to navigate to a draggable item THEN the system SHALL focus the drag handle with visible focus indicators
2. WHEN I press Space on a focused drag handle THEN the system SHALL activate keyboard drag mode
3. WHEN in keyboard drag mode and I press arrow keys THEN the system SHALL move the item up or down in the list
4. WHEN I press Space again during keyboard drag THEN the system SHALL drop the item in its current position
5. WHEN I press Escape during keyboard drag THEN the system SHALL cancel the operation and return the item to its original position

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Speech-Language Pathologist, I want the drag-and-drop functionality to work reliably across different browsers and devices, so that I can use the system consistently regardless of my setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the system on desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) THEN drag-and-drop SHALL function identically
2. WHEN I use the system on touch devices THEN the system SHALL support touch-based drag operations
3. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN drag operations SHALL work locally with eventual persistence
4. WHEN multiple users edit the same template simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts gracefully
5. IF JavaScript is disabled THEN the system SHALL provide fallback controls for reordering items
