## Implementation Notes

### Task Dependencies
- Tasks 1-3 are foundational and should be completed first
- Tasks 4-6 build the core processing engine
- Tasks 7-8 integrate with the existing UI system
- Tasks 9-12 complete the feature implementation
- Tasks 13-16 add polish and production readiness

### Integration Points
- All tasks must maintain compatibility with existing `DynamicStructuredBlock` component
- Database changes should be backward compatible with existing report structure
- API changes should not break existing HTML-based processing
- UI updates should gracefully handle both structured and HTML content

### Testing Strategy
- Each task should include unit tests for new functionality
- Integration tests should verify compatibility with existing system
- End-to-end tests should validate complete user workflows
- Performance tests should ensure scalability with large datasets

### Rollout Approach
- Implement behind feature flags for gradual rollout
- Start with new reports before migrating existing ones
- Provide clear migration paths and user documentation
- Monitor performance and user feedback during rollout
