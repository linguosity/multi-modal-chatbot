# Final Infinite Loop Fix üîÑ

## Problem
Even after the initial fixes, the ReportContext was still causing "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors at line 131 in the handleSave function.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was that multiple save operations were being triggered simultaneously, causing a cascade of state updates that led to infinite re-renders.

## Solution Applied

### **1. Added Save Operation Guard**
```tsx
// Added useRef import
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState, useEffect, useMemo, useRef } from 'react';

// Added ref to track save operations
const isSavingRef = useRef(false);

// Added guard at start of handleSave
const handleSave = async (reportToSave: Report) => {
  // Prevent multiple simultaneous saves
  if (isSavingRef.current) {
    console.log('Save already in progress, skipping...');
    return;
  }
  
  isSavingRef.current = true;
  
  try {
    // ... existing save logic
  } finally {
    isSavingRef.current = false;
  }
};
```

### **2. Removed State Update After Save**
```tsx
// Before (causing infinite loops)
} else {
  console.log('‚úÖ Report auto-saved successfully');
  setReport(reportToSave); // ‚ùå This was triggering more saves
}

// After (safe)
} else {
  console.log('‚úÖ Report auto-saved successfully');
  // Don't update local state here - it should already be current
  // The reportToSave parameter already contains the latest data
}
```

### **3. Proper Error Handling**
- Wrapped the entire save operation in try-finally
- Ensured the saving flag is always reset, even if an error occurs
- Maintained existing error handling and toast notifications

## Expected Results

### **‚úÖ No More Infinite Loops**
- The `isSavingRef` prevents multiple simultaneous save operations
- No more "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors
- Clean console without cascading error messages

### **‚úÖ Proper Save Behavior**
- Auto-save will only run when not already saving
- Manual saves are properly queued/skipped if auto-save is running
- State remains consistent without unnecessary updates

### **‚úÖ Performance Improvements**
- Eliminated unnecessary re-renders
- Reduced CPU usage from infinite loops
- Faster UI responsiveness

## Technical Details

### **Why This Works**
1. **Mutual Exclusion**: Only one save operation can run at a time
2. **State Consistency**: We don't update local state after save since it should already be current
3. **Proper Cleanup**: The finally block ensures the flag is always reset

### **Safe Concurrency**
- If a save is already in progress, new save requests are safely ignored
- The ref-based approach is more reliable than state-based guards
- No race conditions between auto-save and manual save

## Files Modified
- `src/lib/context/ReportContext.tsx` - Added save operation guard and removed problematic state update

**Status**: Infinite loop issue should now be completely resolved! üéâ
