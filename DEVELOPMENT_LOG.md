## July 1, 2025 - UI/UX Refinements & Dynamic Template Initiative

**Summary of Work:**
Today's session focused on further refining the UI/UX of the report detail page, addressing several runtime errors, and initiating the development of dynamic report templates.

**Key Issues Encountered & Resolutions:**

1.  **`autoprefixer` module not found:**
    *   **Problem:** Next.js build failed to find `autoprefixer`, a PostCSS plugin, despite `pnpm install` indicating dependencies were up to date.
    *   **Resolution:** Explicitly added `autoprefixer` as a `devDependency` in `package.json` and re-ran `pnpm install`.

2.  **`ReferenceError: router is not defined` in `src/app/auth/page.tsx`:**
    *   **Problem:** The `router` object was used in a `useEffect` hook without being initialized.
    *   **Resolution:** Added `const router = useRouter();` inside the `LoginPage` component.

3.  **`ReferenceError: supabase is not defined` in `src/app/auth/page.tsx`:**
    *   **Problem:** The `supabase` client instance was used without being initialized.
    *   **Resolution:** Ensured `const supabase = createClient();` was present and correctly scoped within the `LoginPage` component.

4.  **Replacing Radix Dialogs with Custom Modal:**
    *   **Problem:** User requested to replace existing Radix/shadcn Dialog components with a custom modal component based on HyperUI styling.
    *   **Resolution:**
        *   Created `src/components/ui/custom-modal.tsx` with the specified HyperUI modal structure and styling (solid black border, white background, shadow).
        *   Replaced `Dialog` imports and usage in `src/app/dashboard/reports/[id]/page.tsx` with `CustomModal`, mapping props accordingly.

5.  **Report Detail Page Layout Refinements:**
    *   **Problem:** User requested layout changes for "Background Information" and "Unstructured Notes" sections.
    *   **Resolution:**
        *   Removed the "Background Information" header from its card and adjusted its column span.
        *   Wrapped the "Unstructured Notes" section in a `Card` component and moved it to be alongside the "Background Information" card in a two-column layout.
        *   Applied a thinner, solid border to the "Unstructured Notes" card.
        *   Removed the `showJson` debug section.

6.  **"Unstructured Notes" UI/UX Improvements:**
    *   **Problem:** User requested a tooltip for the notes area and an AI icon for the generate button to save space. Also, updated styling for the textarea and file upload.
    *   **Resolution:**
        *   Integrated `@radix-ui/react-tooltip` for the notes area, making the tooltip auto-appear and dismiss on click outside.
        *   Replaced "Generate with AI" button text with a `Sparkles` icon from `lucide-react`.
        *   Applied HyperUI-inspired styling to the `textarea` and updated the file upload component's structure and styling.
        *   Removed the "Unstructured Notes" heading.

7.  **`Module not found: Can't resolve 'zod'`:**
    *   **Problem:** The `zod` package was a dependency but not installed.
    *   **Resolution:** Installed `zod` using `pnpm add zod`.

8.  **Initiating Dynamic Report Templates Feature:**
    *   **Goal:** Enable users to dynamically define and modify report template structures via the UI.
    *   **Resolution:**
        *   Created a new Git branch `feature/dynamic-report-templates`.
        *   Defined Zod schemas for `ReportSectionTypeSchema`, `ReportSectionGroupSchema`, and `ReportTemplateSchema` in `src/lib/schemas/report-template.ts`.

**Files Modified:**
*   `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`
*   `package.json`
*   `pnpm-lock.yaml`
*   `src/app/api/ai/generate-section/route.ts` (examined, no changes made)
*   `src/app/auth/page.tsx`
*   `src/app/dashboard/reports/[id]/page.tsx`
*   `src/components/ui/custom-modal.tsx` (new file)
*   `src/lib/schemas/report-template.ts` (new file)

**Next Steps:**
*   Continue with Phase 1 of the dynamic template plan: Define Supabase tables for `report_templates` and `report_section_types`, and add `template_id` to the `reports` table.
*   Implement API endpoints for template management.
*   Develop the frontend UI for template creation and editing.
*   Integrate dynamic templates into the report viewing page.
*   Address data migration and edge cases for existing reports.
