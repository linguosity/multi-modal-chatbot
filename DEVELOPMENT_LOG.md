## June 30, 2025 - Authentication Flow & UI/UX Refinements

**Summary of Work:**
Today's session focused on resolving persistent `npm install` issues, refining the authentication flow, and addressing UI/UX inconsistencies in the dashboard layout. We encountered several challenging errors, particularly with JSX parsing and TypeScript type conflicts, which required meticulous debugging and a comprehensive rewrite of a key component.

**Key Issues Encountered & Resolutions:**

1.  **`npm install` hanging/`ENOTEMPTY` errors:**
    *   **Problem:** Repeated `npm install` failures, often with `ENOTEMPTY` errors, indicating locked files or corrupted cache. Even after `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json` and `npm cache clean --force`, the issue persisted.
    *   **Resolution:** Forcefully cleared npm cache (`npm cache clean --force`) and performed a `sudo rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json` followed by `sudo find . -name ".eslint-scope*" -exec rm -rf {} +` to ensure a completely clean environment. This resolved the installation issues.

2.  **`useReport must be used within a ReportProvider` error:**
    *   **Problem:** The `useReport` hook was being called in `DashboardLayout` before `ReportProvider` was properly wrapping the component tree, leading to runtime errors.
    *   **Resolution:** Refactored `src/lib/context/ReportContext.tsx` to move the state management and logic for `report`, `handleSave`, `handleDelete`, etc., directly into the `ReportProvider` component (Option A from the provided guidance). This made `ReportProvider` self-contained and eliminated the need to pass props from `DashboardLayout`.

3.  **`Unexpected token ReportProvider. Expected jsx identifier` (JSX parsing error) in `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`:**
    *   **Problem:** Persistent JSX syntax errors in `DashboardLayout.tsx` due to incorrect `div` nesting, causing the React parser to fail. This also led to the main content rendering within the sidebar.
    *   **Resolution:** Meticulously corrected the JSX structure in `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` to ensure a single root element within `ReportProvider` and proper separation of sidebar and main content. This involved removing an extra, misplaced `</div>` tag.

4.  **`Cannot find name 'handleSave'`, `'loading'`, `'showJson'`, `'setShowJson'`, `'handleDelete'` errors in `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`:**
    *   **Problem:** After refactoring `ReportContext`, `DashboardLayout` was still trying to access these variables directly, but they are now managed internally by `ReportProvider`.
    *   **Resolution:** Created a new component `src/components/ReportActions.tsx` to encapsulate the "Save Report", "Show JSON", and "Delete Report" buttons. This component now uses `useReport()` internally. The `DashboardLayout.tsx` was updated to render `<ReportActions />` instead of the individual buttons, resolving these TypeScript errors.

5.  **`createServerClient is not defined` error in `src/app/layout.tsx`:**
    *   **Problem:** Incorrect import and usage of `createServerClient` from `src/lib/supabase/server.ts`. The utility exports `createClient`, not `createServerClient` directly.
    *   **Resolution:** Corrected the import in `src/app/layout.tsx` to `import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server';` and updated the call to `const supabase = createClient();`.

6.  **`SignOutButton' does not contain a default export` error:**
    *   **Problem:** `SignOutButton` was imported as a default export in `src/app/layout.tsx` but was exported as a named export in `src/components/ui/SignOutButton.tsx`.
    *   **Resolution:** Changed the import in `src/app/layout.tsx` to a named import: `import { SignOutButton } from '@/components/ui/SignOutButton';`.

7.  **Redundant `router` and `supabase` declarations in `src/app/auth/page.tsx`:**
    *   **Problem:** `router` and `supabase` were declared twice in `src/app/auth/page.tsx`, leading to compilation errors.
    *   **Resolution:** Removed the duplicate declarations of `router` and `supabase` from `src/app/auth/page.tsx`.

8.  **UI/UX: Redundant header in dashboard and layout issues:**
    *   **Problem:** The main content was rendering in the sidebar, and a redundant header was present in the dashboard layout.
    *   **Resolution:** Removed the extra `</div>` tag in `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` to fix the main content rendering. Removed the `<header>` element from `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` to streamline the UI.

**Files Modified:**
*   `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`
*   `package.json`
*   `pnpm-lock.yaml`
*   `src/app/api/ai/generate-section/route.ts`
*   `src/app/auth/page.tsx`
