## July 1, 2025 - UI/UX Refinements & Dynamic Template Initiative

**Summary of Work:**
Today's session focused on further refining the UI/UX of the report detail page, addressing several runtime errors, and initiating the development of dynamic report templates.

**Key Issues Encountered & Resolutions:**

1.  **`autoprefixer` module not found:**
    *   **Problem:** Next.js build failed to find `autoprefixer`, a PostCSS plugin, despite `pnpm install` indicating dependencies were up to date.
    *   **Resolution:** Explicitly added `autoprefixer` as a `devDependency` in `package.json` and re-ran `pnpm install`.

2.  **`ReferenceError: router is not defined` in `src/app/auth/page.tsx`:**
    *   **Problem:** The `router` object was used in a `useEffect` hook without being initialized.
    *   **Resolution:** Added `const router = useRouter();` inside the `LoginPage` component.

3.  **`ReferenceError: supabase is not defined` in `src/app/auth/page.tsx`:**
    *   **Problem:** The `supabase` client instance was used without being initialized.
    *   **Resolution:** Ensured `const supabase = createClient();` was present and correctly scoped within the `LoginPage` component.

4.  **Replacing Radix Dialogs with Custom Modal:**
    *   **Problem:** User requested to replace existing Radix/shadcn Dialog components with a custom modal component based on HyperUI styling.
    *   **Resolution:**
        *   Created `src/components/ui/custom-modal.tsx` with the specified HyperUI modal structure and styling (solid black border, white background, shadow).
        *   Replaced `Dialog` imports and usage in `src/app/dashboard/reports/[id]/page.tsx` with `CustomModal`, mapping props accordingly.

5.  **Report Detail Page Layout Refinements:**
    *   **Problem:** User requested layout changes for "Background Information" and "Unstructured Notes" sections.
    *   **Resolution:**
        *   Removed the "Background Information" header from its card and adjusted its column span.
        *   Wrapped the "Unstructured Notes" section in a `Card` component and moved it to be alongside the "Background Information" card in a two-column layout.
        *   Applied a thinner, solid border to the "Unstructured Notes" card.
        *   Removed the `showJson` debug section.

6.  **"Unstructured Notes" UI/UX Improvements:**
    *   **Problem:** User requested a tooltip for the notes area and an AI icon for the generate button to save space. Also, updated styling for the textarea and file upload.
    *   **Resolution:**
        *   Integrated `@radix-ui/react-tooltip` for the notes area, making the tooltip auto-appear and dismiss on click outside.
        *   Replaced "Generate with AI" button text with a `Sparkles` icon from `lucide-react`.
        *   Applied HyperUI-inspired styling to the `textarea` and updated the file upload component's structure and styling.
        *   Removed the "Unstructured Notes" heading.

7.  **`Module not found: Can't resolve 'zod'`:**
    *   **Problem:** The `zod` package was a dependency but not installed.
    *   **Resolution:** Installed `zod` using `pnpm add zod`.

8.  **Initiating Dynamic Report Templates Feature:**
    *   **Goal:** Enable users to dynamically define and modify report template structures via the UI.
    *   **Resolution:**
        *   Created a new Git branch `feature/dynamic-report-templates`.
        *   Defined Zod schemas for `ReportSectionTypeSchema`, `ReportSectionGroupSchema`, and `ReportTemplateSchema` in `src/lib/schemas/report-template.ts`.

## July 2, 2025 - Dynamic Template Implementation & Error Resolution

**Summary of Work:**
Continued implementation of dynamic report templates, focusing on API endpoints, frontend editor UI, and resolving numerous build and runtime errors.

**Key Issues Encountered & Resolutions:**

1.  **Supabase Table Creation:**
    *   **Problem:** Initial attempts to create `report_templates` and `report_section_types` tables in Supabase failed due to incorrect SQL copy-pasting (including line numbers/shell commands).
    *   **Resolution:** Provided SQL commands in separate `.sql` files for direct execution in Supabase editor, resolving syntax errors.

2.  **`PGRST116` (Supabase update/insert failure):**
    *   **Problem 1 (PUT):** `initialTemplateState.id` was being initialized with a `uuidv4()`, causing new templates to always attempt a `PUT` instead of a `POST`.
    *   **Resolution 1:** Set `initialTemplateState.id` to `undefined` in `src/components/template-editor.tsx` and explicitly called `setEditingTemplate(undefined)` when creating a new template.
    *   **Problem 2 (POST Zod validation for `user_id`):** The `user_id` was an empty string in the frontend payload, failing `z.string().uuid()` validation on the server.
    *   **Resolution 2:** Made `user_id` optional in `ReportTemplateSchema` in `src/lib/schemas/report-template.ts`.
    *   **Problem 3 (POST Zod validation for `groups` and `datetime`):** The `groups` field was `undefined` in the data returned from Supabase's `insert` (it was under `template_structure`), and `created_at`/`updated_at` datetime formats were too strict for Zod.
    *   **Resolution 3:** Mapped `data.template_structure` to `groups` during Zod parsing in `POST` and `GET` API routes, and relaxed `created_at`/`updated_at` to `z.string().optional()` in `ReportTemplateSchema`.

3.  **`ReferenceError: self is not defined` (recurring):**
    *   **Problem:** Browser-only libraries (`sortable-tree`) being evaluated on the server, even with `next/dynamic` at the page level.
    *   **Resolution:** Created `src/components/client-sortable-tree.tsx` as a client-only wrapper for `sortable-tree` and dynamically imported this wrapper in `src/components/template-editor.tsx`. Also, ensured `src/components/template-editor.tsx` was marked `'use client'`.

4.  **`Element type is invalid`:**
    *   **Problem:** `next/dynamic` expecting a default export but receiving a named export (or the entire module object).
    *   **Resolution:** Changed `TemplateEditor` in `src/components/template-editor.tsx` to a default export.

5.  **TypeScript Schema vs. Value Confusion (`Property 'default_title' does not exist`):**
    *   **Problem:** `ReportSectionTypeSchema` in `src/lib/schemas/report-template.ts` was missing the `default_title` field, which was present in the database and expected by the frontend.
    *   **Resolution:** Added `default_title: z.string()` to `ReportSectionTypeSchema`.

6.  **`Syntax Error: Expected 'from', got 'n'`:**
    *   **Problem:** Typo (`Input }n`) in an import statement in `src/components/template-editor.tsx`.
    *   **Resolution:** Corrected the typo.

7.  **Next.js 15 `cookies()` and `params.id` changes:**
    *   **Problem 1 (`cookies()` should be awaited):** `cookies()` became asynchronous in Route Handlers/Server Actions, but `createClient()` was called synchronously.
    *   **Resolution 1:** Introduced `createRouteSupabase()` (async) for Route Handlers and `createServerSupabase()` (sync) for Server Components. Updated all API routes to `await createRouteSupabase()`.
    *   **Problem 2 (`params.id` warning):** `params` became a Promise in Next.js 15.
    *   **Resolution 2:** Used `React.use(params)` in `src/app/dashboard/reports/[id]/page.tsx` (though later reverted to direct access as it's a Client Component and `useParams` is preferred).
    *   **Problem 3 (Hook mismatch in `ReportContext.tsx`):** Conditional logic (`if (!reportId) return;`) inside `useEffect`'s callback.
    *   **Resolution 3:** Moved `if (!reportId) return;` to the top of the `useEffect` callback.
    *   **Problem 4 (Client/Server Component Supabase client mismatch):** Using `createBrowserSupabase` in Server Components or `createServerSupabase` in Client Components.
    *   **Resolution 4:** Systematically updated all imports and usages to ensure `createBrowserSupabase` is used in Client Components and `createServerSupabase` is used in Server Components/Route Handlers.

## July 3, 2025 - Dependency Upgrades & Structured Logging

**Summary of Work:**
Addressed `npm install` warnings and `npm audit` vulnerabilities. Implemented structured logging using Pino.

**Key Issues Encountered & Resolutions:**

1.  **`npm install` warnings (deprecated packages):**
    *   **Problem:** Warnings about deprecated `rimraf`, `inflight`, `@humanwhocodes`, `glob`, and `eslint`.
    *   **Resolution:**
        *   Upgraded `rimraf` to `^5`.
        *   `inflight` and `@humanwhocodes` were transitive and not directly imported, so no direct action was taken beyond hoping `glob` upgrade would resolve them.
        *   Upgraded `glob` to `^10`.
        *   `eslint` was already at latest `8.x`.

2.  **`npm audit` vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Problem:** Multiple vulnerabilities, including critical and high severity, primarily related to the `next` package.
    *   **Resolution:** Upgraded `next` to `latest` (version `15.3.4`), which resolved most vulnerabilities. A low-severity `cookie` vulnerability remains (transitive dependency of `@supabase/ssr`), which was noted.

3.  **Missing Test Script:**
    *   **Problem:** No `test` script defined in `package.json`.
    *   **Resolution:** Not directly resolved, but noted as a recommendation to add a test script.

4.  **Structured Logging Implementation:**
    *   **Problem:** Lack of structured logging for better error management in production.
    *   **Resolution:**
        *   Installed `pino` and `pino-pretty`.
        *   Created `src/lib/logger.ts` for a centralized Pino logger instance.
        *   Replaced `console.log`/`warn`/`error` with `logger.info`/`warn`/`error` in all API routes (`src/app/api/ai/generate-section/route.ts`, `src/app/api/report-templates/route.ts`, `src/app/api/report-templates/[id]/route.ts`, `src/app/api/reports/route.ts`) and `src/lib/supabase/server.ts`.

**Files Modified:**
*   `CODE_AUDIT_REPORT.md`
*   `package.json`
*   `pnpm-lock.yaml`
*   `src/app/api/ai/generate-section/route.ts`
*   `src/app/api/report-templates/route.ts`
*   `src/app/api/report-templates/[id]/route.ts`
*   `src/app/api/reports/route.ts`
*   `src/lib/logger.ts` (new file)
*   `src/lib/supabase/server.ts`

**Next Steps:**
*   Continue with Phase 1 of the dynamic template plan: Define Supabase tables for `report_templates` and `report_section_types`, and add `template_id` to the `reports` table.
*   Implement API endpoints for template management.
*   Develop the frontend UI for template creation and editing.
*   Integrate dynamic templates into the report viewing page.
*   Address data migration and edge cases for existing reports.

## July 8, 2025 - AI Generation and Drag-and-Drop Overhaul

**Summary of Work:**
Today's session was a deep dive into fixing several critical, subtle bugs in the AI content generation loop and the report section drag-and-drop functionality. We successfully implemented a robust multi-tool-use loop for the Anthropic API and resolved a persistent UI issue with dragging components.

**Key Issues Encountered & Resolutions:**

1.  **AI Only Updating One Section:**
    *   **Problem:** The Anthropic API call would only ever update a single report section, even when the prompt requested multiple updates. The API `stop_reason` was `tool_use`, indicating the model had more to do but the backend loop was not implemented correctly.
    *   **Resolution:** Refactored the `/api/ai/generate-section` route to implement a proper multi-tool-use loop. The new logic now continues the conversation with the AI, feeding back `tool_result` messages until the model signals completion, allowing it to update multiple sections in one go.

2.  **Anthropic API `400 Bad Request` Error:**
    *   **Problem:** The new AI loop was failing with a `400` error due to an invalid payload.
    *   **Resolution:** Corrected the `tool_result` message payload by changing the `isError` key to the required snake_case `is_error`.

3.  **Server Error: "non-existent section_id"**
    *   **Problem:** The AI would return a human-readable slug (e.g., `reason_for_referral`) as the section ID, but the database uses UUIDs, causing lookups to fail.
    *   **Resolution:** Implemented a server-side map to translate the slugs from the AI's tool call into the correct UUIDs before updating the report state.

4.  **Drag-and-Drop Not Working:**
    *   **Problem:** Report sections were not draggable, despite the drag handle being visible. Initial fixes to the sensor configuration were unsuccessful.
    *   **Resolution:** After confirming that drag events were firing, the issue was isolated to a conflict between `@dnd-kit` and `framer-motion`. Replacing the `motion.div` wrapper with a standard `div` in the `SortableSection` component resolved the issue and made the sections draggable.

5.  **React Error: "Cannot update a component while rendering..."**
    *   **Problem:** A persistent warning about improper `setState` calls during the render phase, originating from the `ReportProvider`.
    *   **Resolution:** This issue was investigated but the root cause was elusive. The fix from a previous session (memoizing the Supabase client) was confirmed to be in place. The issue seems to have been resolved as a side-effect of other fixes, but the root cause was not definitively identified.
