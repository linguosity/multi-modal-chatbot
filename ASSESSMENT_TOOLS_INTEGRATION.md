# Assessment Tools Integration into Assessment Results

## Overview
Moved assessment tools from a separate section into the Assessment Results page as compact, dynamic cards that only show populated fields.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Assessment Tools from Navigation
- **Removed from sidebar groups** (`src/components/ReportSidebar.tsx`)
- **Removed from schema mapping** (`src/lib/structured-schemas.ts`)
- Streamlined navigation by eliminating redundant section

### 2. Enhanced Assessment Results Schema
Added `assessment_tools` array to the Assessment Results section with fields:
- `tool_name` (required) - Name of the assessment tool
- `tool_type` - Standardized Test, Informal Assessment, Observation, Interview
- `author` - Test author(s)
- `year_published` - Publication year
- `standard_score` - Quantitative score
- `percentile` - Percentile rank
- `qualitative_description` - Qualitative interpretation

### 3. Created Compact AssessmentToolCard Component
**Features:**
- **Conditional rendering** - Only shows fields that have values
- **Inline editing** - Click to edit any field directly
- **Hover interactions** - Remove button appears on hover
- **Compressed layout** - Uses CSS design tokens for consistent spacing
- **Field highlighting** - Integrates with AI update system

**Layout:**
- Tool name (prominent, editable)
- Tool type (dropdown, if populated)
- Author • Year (inline, if populated)
- Scores grid (3-column: Score, %ile, Level - if any scores exist)
- "+ Add scores" button (if no scores present)

### 4. Created AssessmentToolsGrid Component
**Features:**
- **Responsive grid** - 1 column mobile, 2 tablet, 3 desktop
- **Add tool button** - Unified accent color
- **Empty state** - Clean placeholder when no tools added
- **Dynamic sizing** - Cards adapt to content

### 5. Integration with DynamicStructuredBlock
- Added special case handling for `assessment_tools` field
- Renders `AssessmentToolsGrid` component
- Maintains proper data flow and field highlighting

## UI/UX Improvements Applied

### Design Tokens Used
- `--pad-card: 1rem` - Compressed card padding
- `--gap-grid: 1rem` - Consistent grid spacing
- `--clr-accent: #546FFF` - Unified accent color
- `--text-base: 15px` - Consistent text sizing
- `--text-label: 13px` - Micro-labels
- `--radius: 6px` - Consistent border radius

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Tool name** - Prominent, editable text
- **Metadata** - Subtle, inline (author • year)
- **Scores** - Organized 3-column grid with micro-labels
- **Actions** - Hidden until hover (remove button)

### Conditional Display
- Empty fields are not rendered (no visual clutter)
- Scores section only appears if any score is populated
- Author/year line only appears if either is populated
- "+ Add scores" button appears only when no scores exist

## Data Structure Example

```json
{
  "assessment_tools": [
    {
      "tool_name": "PLS-5",
      "tool_type": "Standardized Test",
      "author": "Zimmerman, Steiner, & Pond",
      "year_published": 2011,
      "standard_score": 85,
      "percentile": 16,
      "qualitative_description": "Low Average"
    },
    {
      "tool_name": "Language Sample",
      "tool_type": "Informal Assessment"
      // No scores - card will be compact, no scores section
    }
  ]
}
```

3. **Compact Display** - Only shows relevant information
