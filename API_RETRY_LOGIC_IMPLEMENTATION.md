# API Retry Logic Implementation

## 🎯 **Problem Addressed**
The Anthropic API was returning 529 "Overloaded" errors, causing the AI processing to fail completely. This is a temporary server-side issue that should be handled gracefully with retry logic.

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Exponential Backoff Retry Logic**
```typescript
// Retry logic for overloaded errors
let retryCount = 0;
const maxRetries = 3;
const baseDelay = 2000; // 2 seconds

while (retryCount <= maxRetries) {
  try {
    response = await anthropic.messages.create({...});
    break; // Success - exit retry loop
  } catch (apiError: any) {
    const isOverloaded = apiError?.status === 529 || 
                        apiError?.error?.type === 'overloaded_error' ||
                        apiError?.message?.includes('Overloaded');
    
    if (isOverloaded && retryCount < maxRetries) {
      retryCount++;
      const delay = baseDelay * Math.pow(2, retryCount - 1); // Exponential backoff
      console.log(`⚠️ Anthropic API overloaded (attempt ${retryCount}/${maxRetries + 1}), retrying in ${delay}ms...`);
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
      continue;
    }
    
    throw apiError; // Re-throw if not overloaded or max retries reached
  }
}
```

### **2. Retry Schedule**
- **Attempt 1**: Immediate
- **Attempt 2**: Wait 2 seconds
- **Attempt 3**: Wait 4 seconds  
- **Attempt 4**: Wait 8 seconds
- **Total**: Up to 4 attempts over ~14 seconds

### **3. Enhanced Error Handling**
```typescript
} catch (error: any) {
  const isOverloaded = error?.status === 529 || 
                      error?.error?.type === 'overloaded_error' ||
                      error?.message?.includes('Overloaded');
  
  if (isOverloaded) {
    console.log('🔄 Anthropic API is currently overloaded. The system will continue processing with available data.');
  } else {
    console.log('💥 Non-recoverable API error, stopping processing.');
  }
  
  break; // Exit processing loop
}
```

### **4. User-Friendly Response Messages**
```typescript
const hadApiIssues = !analysisResult && processedFiles.length > 0;
const baseMessage = `Successfully processed ${processedFiles.length} files and updated ${updatedSections.length} sections`;
const apiIssueMessage = hadApiIssues ? 
  ' (Note: AI analysis was limited due to temporary API overload - please try again in a few minutes for full processing)' : '';

const response = {
  success: true,
  message: baseMessage + apiIssueMessage,
  apiIssues: hadApiIssues
};
```

## 🔧 **Features**

### **Automatic Recovery**
- Detects 529 overloaded errors specifically
- Automatically retries with exponential backoff
- Continues processing if retries succeed

### **Graceful Degradation**
- If all retries fail, returns partial results
- Informs user about API limitations
- Suggests trying again later

### **Detailed Logging**
- Logs retry attempts with timing
- Shows final completion time including retries
- Distinguishes between recoverable and non-recoverable errors

### **User Experience**
- Processing doesn't completely fail
- Clear messaging about temporary limitations
- Encourages users to retry for full processing

## 🎯 **Benefits**

### **For Users**
- **Resilient Processing**: Temporary API issues don't cause complete failures
- **Clear Communication**: Users understand when processing is limited
- **Actionable Guidance**: Users know to try again for full results

### **For System**
- **Improved Reliability**: Handles temporary API overloads gracefully
- **Better Monitoring**: Detailed logging of retry attempts and outcomes
- **Maintained Functionality**: Core features continue working during API issues

## 🧪 **Error Scenarios Handled**

1. **529 Overloaded Error**: Retry with exponential backoff
2. **Temporary Network Issues**: Automatic retry attempts
3. **API Rate Limiting**: Backoff strategy respects server load
4. **Partial Processing**: Returns available results even if AI analysis fails

## 📊 **Expected Behavior**

### **Success Case**
```
⏱️ Starting Anthropic API call...
⏱️ API call completed in 2500ms
📊 Response stop_reason: tool_use
✅ Processing completed successfully
```

### **Retry Case**
```
⏱️ Starting Anthropic API call...
⚠️ Anthropic API overloaded (attempt 1/4), retrying in 2000ms...
⚠️ Anthropic API overloaded (attempt 2/4), retrying in 4000ms...
⏱️ API call completed in 8500ms (after 2 retries)
✅ Processing completed successfully
```

### **Graceful Failure Case**
```
⏱️ Starting Anthropic API call...
⚠️ Anthropic API overloaded (attempt 1/4), retrying in 2000ms...
⚠️ Anthropic API overloaded (attempt 2/4), retrying in 4000ms...
⚠️ Anthropic API overloaded (attempt 3/4), retrying in 8000ms...
🔄 Anthropic API is currently overloaded. The system will continue processing with available data.
✅ Processed 1 files (AI analysis limited - try again later)
```

## 🚀 **Result**
The system is now much more resilient to temporary API issues while maintaining a good user experience. Users will see their files processed even during API overload periods, with clear guidance on when to retry for full AI analysis.
