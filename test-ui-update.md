# UI Update Test Plan

## Changes Made:

1. **Removed `window.location.reload()`** - No more full page refreshes
2. **Added `refreshReport()` function** - Efficiently fetches updated data from database
3. **Added visual feedback** - Shows "Updating..." status during refresh
4. **Added automatic content sync** - Section content updates when report data changes
5. **Added visual animation** - Pulse effect on updated sections

## Expected Behavior:

1. **Upload PDF through AI Assistant**
2. **API processes PDF and updates database** (already working)
3. **UI shows "Updating..." status** (new)
4. **Report data refreshes from database** (new)
5. **Section content updates automatically** (new)
6. **Visual pulse animation on updated section** (new)
7. **Toast notification shows what was updated** (existing)

## Test Steps:

1. Navigate to a report section
2. Open AI Assistant
3. Upload a PDF file
4. Watch for:
   - "Updating..." status appears
   - Section content updates without page reload
   - Pulse animation on content area
   - Toast notification

## Key Improvements:

- **No more jarring page reloads**
- **Smooth, real-time updates**
- **Visual feedback during processing**
